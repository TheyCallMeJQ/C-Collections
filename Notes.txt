^n in C# gives us the same functionality as python's [-n] indexing

C# has Array functions 
    Find; Find in JS
    FindAll; Filter in JS 

Access List through System.Collections.Generic    

When to use a List vs an array:
    - if we don't know the size of the list 
    - if we need to add or remove items dynamically
    
List types:
- Array 
    - Fixed length determined on initialization
- List 
    - Variable length
- SortedList
    - Variable length with O(n) insertion
- Dictionary 
    - key-value entries, O(1) access.
- HashSet 
    - No repetition of items, supports logical operations (i.e. Intersection, union, difference)
- Multidimensional array 
    - Fixed-sized multidimensional array, differences in lengths can be accounted for with null values
- Jagged array 
    - variable length multidimensional arrays
- Queue
    - FIFO
- Stack   
    - LIFO
